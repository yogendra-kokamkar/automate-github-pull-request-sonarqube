# Automated Code Review Pipeline with Jenkins and SonarQube

## Overview

This Jenkins Pipeline automates the code review process for pull requests from feature branches to the main branch. It utilizes Jenkins, SonarQube, and email notifications to streamline code review workflows and ensure code quality.

## Workflow

1. **Pull Request Creation:**
   - Whenever a developer creates a pull request from a feature branch to the main branch, this pipeline is triggered automatically.

2. **Code Checkout:**
   - The pipeline checks out the code from the feature branch to perform code analysis.

3. **SonarQube Scan:**
   - The pipeline runs a SonarQube scan to analyze the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and maintainability issues.

4. **Email Notification:**
   - After the SonarQube scan completes, an email notification is sent to the designated reviewer(s) containing the scan results.

5. **Reviewer Decision:**
   - The reviewer(s) have the option to accept or reject the pull request based on the scan results.

6. **Pull Request Management:**
   - If the reviewer accepts the pull request, it is merged into the main branch.
   - If the reviewer rejects the pull request, the pipeline run is aborted, and appropriate actions can be taken by the development team.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Jenkins and SonarQube:**
   - Install and configure Jenkins and SonarQube on your server. Refer to the official documentation for installation instructions.

2. **Install Required Plugins:**
   - Install the following Jenkins plugins:
     - Pipeline
     - SonarQube Scanner
     - Email Extension

3. **Configure Jenkins Pipeline:**
   - Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Define the Jenkinsfile with the pipeline script provided in this repository.

4. **Configure SonarQube Integration:**
   - Configure the SonarQube server details in the Jenkinsfile for SonarQube scan.

5. **Configure Email Notification:**
   - Configure the SMTP server settings in Jenkins for sending email notifications.
   - Customize the email template and recipient addresses in the Jenkinsfile.

6. **Set Up Pull Request Triggers:**
   - Configure the Jenkins job to trigger on pull request events from the version control system (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket).

7. **Define Reviewer Workflow:**
   - Define the workflow for reviewers to review the code, make decisions, and interact with the pipeline.

8. **Test the Pipeline:**
   - Test the pipeline by creating pull requests and verifying the automated code review process.
